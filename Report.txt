SimpleSecureLogin System

1. Introduction

This report provides an overview of the `SimpleSecureLogin` Python application. The application implements a basic yet secure user authentication system. It incorporates industry-standard practices for password storage and adds an additional layer of security through Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP). User data is persisted in a local JSON file.

2. System Overview

The `SimpleSecureLogin` system is designed to manage user registration and secure login processes. It focuses on protecting user credentials through robust hashing and verification mechanisms and enhances account security with mandatory 2FA. The core functionality is encapsulated within the `SimpleSecureLogin` class.

3. Core Components and Functionality

The system is built around the `SimpleSecureLogin` class, which handles all aspects of user management:

*   Data Persistence (`data_file`, `load_users`, `save_users`):
    *   User information (hashed passwords, 2FA secrets) is stored in a JSON file (default: `users.json`).
    *   `load_users`: Reads user data from the JSON file upon initialization. Handles cases where the file doesn't exist or is corrupted by returning an empty user dictionary.
    *   `save_users`: Writes the current in-memory user data back to the JSON file, ensuring persistence across program runs.

*   Secure Password Management (`hash_password`, `verify_password`):
    *   `hash_password`: Uses the PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 algorithm with a high iteration count (100,000) and a unique, cryptographically secure random salt for each password. This protects against brute-force and rainbow table attacks. The salt and the resulting hash are concatenated and stored.
    *   `verify_password`: Retrieves the stored salt, re-hashes the user-provided password using the same salt and parameters, and securely compares the computed hash with the stored hash using `secrets.compare_digest` to prevent timing attacks.

*   Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) (`setup_2fa`, `verify_2fa`):
    *   `setup_2fa`: Generates a unique Base32 secret key for a user using the `pyotp` library. This secret is stored and associated with the user. It provides a provisioning URI (containing the secret, username, and issuer name) that can be scanned by an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator) or the secret key for manual entry. It saves the secret immediately.
    *   `verify_2fa`: Uses the stored secret to create a TOTP object. It validates a 6-digit code entered by the user against the code generated by the authenticator app for the current time window, allowing for minor clock drift.

*   User Management (`register`, `login`):
    *   `register`:
        1.  Checks for username uniqueness.
        2.  Enforces password policies (minimum 8 characters, must not contain the username).
        3.  Stores the user's information with a hashed password and initializes the 2FA secret.
        4.  Automatically initiates and guides the user through the 2FA setup process.
        5.  Requires the user to successfully verify a 2FA code immediately after setup to confirm it works before completing registration.
    *   `login`:
        1.  Verifies the existence of the username.
        2.  Authenticates the user's password using the secure `verify_password` method.
        3.  Prompts the user for the current 2FA code from their authenticator app.
        4.  Validates the 2FA code using the `verify_2fa` method.
        5.  Grants access only if both password and 2FA are correct.

*   Main Execution Block (`if __name__ == "__main__"`):
    *   Provides a simple command-line interface for users to choose between registering a new account or logging into an existing one.
    *   Instantiates the `SimpleSecureLogin` class.
    *   Handles user input for username and password for both registration and login flows.
    *   Calls the appropriate methods (`register` or `login`) based on user choice.

4. Security Features

*   Password Hashing: PBKDF2 with SHA256 and a unique salt per password ensures strong protection against various password cracking techniques.
*   Timing Attack Resistance: Uses `secrets.compare_digest` for password verification to prevent attackers from gaining information based on response time differences.
*   Two-Factor Authentication: Mandatory TOTP 2FA significantly increases account security by requiring something the user *has* (their phone/app) in addition to something they *know* (their password).
*   Secure Randomness: Utilizes the `secrets` module for generating salts and the `pyotp` library for generating 2FA secrets, ensuring cryptographic strength.

5. Dependencies

*   `hashlib`: For the PBKDF2 hashing algorithm.
*   `secrets`: For generating cryptographically secure random numbers (salts, 2FA secrets).
*   `pyotp`: For generating and verifying TOTP codes.
*   `json`: For reading and writing user data to a file.
*   `os`: For checking file existence.

6. Conclusion

The `SimpleSecureLogin` system demonstrates a practical implementation of secure user authentication in Python. By combining strong password hashing with mandatory Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) 2FA, it provides a robust defense against common authentication threats. The use of standard libraries and clear separation of concerns in the class design makes the system understandable and maintainable. The command-line interface offers a straightforward way for users to interact with the registration and login processes.
